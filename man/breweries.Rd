\details{
This dataset contains selected breweries in Franconia. It is partly a
subset of a larger database that was compiled by students at the
University of Marburg for a seminar called
"The Geography of Beer: sustainability in the food industry"
and partly consists of breweries downloaded from
\url{https://www.bierwandern.de/inhalt/brauereiliste.html} with the kind permission
of Rainer Kastl. Note that use of these data is restricted to  non-commercial use
and that they are explicitly excluded from the GPL license that mapview is licensed under.

#  Arctic Web Map as provided by ArcticConnect (AC)

[Arctic Connect](http://arcticconnect.org/services) provides with Arctic Web Map (AWM) an Arctic-specific web mapping tool. It is a Javascript Library that can be used for adequate arctic map projections "especially for for scientifically accurate visualization and analysis" They think as me that it is a function that is "critical for arctic system research but missing in existing web mapping platforms". To keep it simple you can use the example map.types$AC settings to connect to their really beautiful backgraund maps.



```{r ac,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9.47,cache=FALSE}

library(mapview)
library(raster)

### load Greenlands roads data from geofabrik
data("roadsGRL")

 # load the list of the above example
 data("map.types")

### map the AC data
mapview::projView(roadsGRL, map.types = map.types$AC)
```

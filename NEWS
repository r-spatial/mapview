  * cubeView: view raster bricks or stacks hovmoeller style, use keys up & down, left & right, page up & page down to navigate through y, x, z dimensions, respectively.
  * labels: if zcol is set, mouseover will now show the repesctive values of zcol, if zcol is not set moseover shows feature ID. Only available if suitable leaflet package version is installed.

changes:
  * spplot method has been removed.
  * colors: viridis based colors now default if viridisLite package is available.
  * basemaps: new default basemap is "CartoDB.Positron" as colors of features are better visible on the grey background.

bugfixes:
  * if attribute was of class "character" mapview did through an error if passed to zcol.

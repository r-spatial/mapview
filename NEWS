  * sync: synchronise two or more leaflet maps (thanks to Kenton Russell).
  * mapshot: to save maps as html page or static image or both.
  * knitr integration (i.e. no need to call the @map slot anymore to render in knitr).
  * cubeView: view raster bricks or stacks hovmoeller style, use keys up & down, left & right, page up & page down to navigate through y, x, z dimensions, respectively.
  * labels: if zcol is set, mouseover will now show the repesctive values of zcol, if zcol is not set moseover shows feature ID. Only available if suitable leaflet package version is installed.
  * new popup functions popupTable, popupGraph and popupImage.
  * functions to turn coordinates into spatial lines or spatial polygons.
  * mapview objects now work natively on shiny applications (i.e. renderMapview and mapviewOutput now available).
  * "zcol = Var" in combination with burst = TRUE now plots one layer for each unique value of the variable supplied to zcol.

changes:
  * spplot method has been removed.
  * colors: viridis based colors now default if viridisLite package is available.
  * basemaps: new default basemap is "CartoDB.Positron" as colors of features are better visible on the grey background.

bugfixes:
  * if attribute was of class "character" mapview did through an error if passed to zcol.
